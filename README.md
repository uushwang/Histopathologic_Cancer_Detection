# Histopathologic_Cancer_Detection
The Histopathologic Cancer Detection challenge is about predicting the presence of metastatic cancer in histopathologic images of lymph node sections. The dataset consists of highly resolved images of tissue samples stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). The task is to classify these images into two categories: those containing metastatic tissue and those that do not.
